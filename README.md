# Movies - Extract, Transform, Load
## Overview of the Project
### Purpose
Amazing Prime Video, one of the worldâ€™s largest streaming services for movies and tv shows, is sponsoring a hackathon. They want to predict which low budget movies will become popular. We were tasked with helping Britta create clean data sets for the hackathon. We refactored our previous code to create one function to extract new data, perform the appropriate transformations, and load it into an SQL table. Through the process of ETL, we are able to provide the hackathon with clean data sets.
